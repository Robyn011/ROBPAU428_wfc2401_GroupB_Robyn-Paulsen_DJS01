# DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge outlines the debugging process for a piece of code and documents the changes made to improve its readability, accuracy, and robustness.


## Original code

1. **Unit Mismatch**: The provided functions fail to convert units correctly, leading to calculation inaccuracies.
2. **Parameter Misalignment**: Parameters are not handled in a way that prevents or highlights the potential for unit mismatch errors, leading to possible confusion.


## Expected Corrected Results

- **New Velocity**: Approximately 48880 km/h after correction.
- **New Distance**: Approximately 10000 km after correction.
- **Remaining Fuel**: Approximately 3,200 kg after correction.

## My Task

1. Enhance code readability for easier debugging.
2. Identify and correct calculation errors.
3. Improve the robustness of calculations. If incorrect units are used or other errors are detected, the code should notify the user instead of producing an incorrect result.


## Changes made

- Use object destructuring in function parameters for better clarity.
- Implement accurate unit conversions within the functions.
- Ensure the corrected functions address the issues of unit mismatches and parameter clarity.

## In Progress
- Completeing my "if else" loop within my function
- Completing READMe file
